2. Open Visual Studio Code: Launch Visual Studio Code.

3. Open Integrated Terminal: You can open the integrated terminal in VS Code by going to the menu and selecting View > Terminal, or by using the shortcut (Ctrl + `).

4. Initialize a Git Repository: Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run the following command to initialize a Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

5. Add Remote Repository: If you have a remote repository (like on GitHub), you need to add it as a remote. Use the following command, replacing the URL with your repository's URL:
   ```
   git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
   ```

6. Stage Changes: To stage your changes for commit, use:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
   This command stages all changes in the current directory.

7. Commit Changes: After staging, commit your changes using:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

8. Push Changes: To push your changes to the remote repository, use:
   ```
   git push origin master
   ```
   If youâ€™re using a different branch (like main), replace `master` with your branch name.

9. Pull Changes: To pull the latest changes from the remote repository, use:
   ```
   git pull origin master
   ```
   Again, replace `master` with your branch name if necessary.

10. Authentication: If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.
